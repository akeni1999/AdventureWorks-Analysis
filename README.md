## Adventure Works Cycle Analysis

### Situation

Adventure Works is a multinational manufacturing corporation specializing primarily in clothing, bicycles, and accessories.

### Task

- I was tasked with analyzing the sales, products, and customer performance using the sales data spanning from 2020 to 2021.
- My responsibility involved transforming raw data into comprehensive reports and intuitive dashboards, enabling the management team to track key performance indicators (KPIs), compare regional achievements, delve into product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

### Action

- I have developed a dynamic and user-friendly Power BI dashboard that enables insightful analysis and delivers meaningful insights to the stakeholders.
- To ensure data accuracy and consistency, I utilized the power query editor extensively, applying data transformation techniques to clean up and normalize the data.
- Built a relational data model, where I established table relationships, carefully understood cardinality, and managed filter flow for seamless data exploration.
- Analyzing data using (DAX) Data Analysis Expression to create Calculated Column and Measures with common functions and formulas.
- Key metrics were effectively displayed using cards and KPI visuals, while various chart types such as matrix, line charts, tree maps, gauges, maps, clustered bar charts, donut charts, and line and clustered column charts were employed to visually present the data in an engaging manner.
- Furthermore, I optimized user interaction by customizing Power BI interactions through slicers and added drill-through filters for deeper dives into specific data segments. With precise control, I implemented page level, report level, and visual level filters, ensuring the users can tailor the dashboard to their specific needs.
- To facilitate easier navigation and storytelling, I incorporated bookmarks, enabling the stakeholders to capture and revisit critical findings effortlessly.
